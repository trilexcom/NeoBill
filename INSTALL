NOTE: For the most up-to-date installation documentation please visit the
      Solid-State Homepage: http://www.solid-state.org

* SolidState requires the Smarty PHP template library be installed on your system.
  You can find instructions for installing Smarty over at:

    http://smarty.php.net/manual/en/installation.php

  Note the directory that you install Smarty to.  You will need to make sure that 
  this directory is accessible to PHP (i.e. if you're using safe_mode).

* Copy the SolidState source tree to your web root directory

* Make sure that the user your web server runs as (i.e. apache) has
  read & write permissions on the following directories:

    manager/smarty/cache
    manager/smarty/templates_c

* Create a new MySQL database:

    $ mysqladmin -u root -p create solidstate

* Grant privileges for the solidstate database:

    $ mysql -u root -p

    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON solidstate.* TO apache@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

    Where: 'apache@localhost' is the username of your web server's MySQL account
           'password' is the user's password

* Don't forget to activate your new privleges:

    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;           

* Import the Solid-State DB scheme:

    $ mysql -u apache -p solidstate < manager/db/solid-state.mysql.sql

* Create your config.inc.php by copying the example template, config.template:

    $ cp config.template config.inc.php

* Edit config.inc.php:

  - Make sure that the smarty_path variable is properly set to the location of 
    Smarty.class.php on your system.

  - Configure your database

* Open a web browser and visit: http://<your-host>/path/to/solidstate/manager

* Login as admin, password: temp

* Goto "Administration / My Info" and change your password

* Goto "Administration / Settings" and edit your configuration settings.
